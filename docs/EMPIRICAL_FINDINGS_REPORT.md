# Empirical Findings Report (Summary)

*Note: This document is a summary of the original empirical findings report, which is currently missing. The content is sourced from `docs/PR-breathing-dynamics/README.md`.*

## Previous Findings

Prior experiments tested biological encodings based on:
1.  **Multi-property**: polarizability, H-bonding, stacking energy
2.  **Pairing-based**: Watson-Crick strength, structural stability
3.  **Thermodynamic**: melting temperature, CRISPR preferences

**Result**: All showed **negative correlation** (arbitrary > biological) with Cohen's d values from -0.579 to -2.549.

**Critical insight from analysis**: Traditional biochemical properties (polarizability, thermodynamics) may not translate effectively to frequency-domain representations.
