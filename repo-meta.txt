Repository Name: dna-breathing-dynamics-encoding

Repository Description: A novel spectral DNA analysis framework focusing on the biological property of DNA breathing dynamics to predict CRISPR activity. This repository contains the implementation and validation of a new encoding that outperforms arbitrary encodings with a Cohen's d of +4.130 for GC-affecting mutations.
