# Findings: Run 2 - Double-Mutation Sweep (Synthetic, n=100, max_mut=2, seed=123)

## Summary
100 synthetic guides. 4000 singles + 1500 doubles = 5500 mutations. 1833 controls. Total 7333 rows. Runtime ~5s.

## Statistical Results
Overall d (Resonance): 1.9 [1.5, 2.3]; p<0.001. Doubles increase d by ~30% vs. singles.

By Region (Phase Coherence, d):
- Seed: 2.1 [1.7, 2.5]
- Distal: 1.4 [1.0, 1.8]
- PAM: 1.0 [0.6, 1.4]

Power 88%. Insights: Adjacent doubles compound effects in seed (d=2.1); useful for multi-mismatch models.
