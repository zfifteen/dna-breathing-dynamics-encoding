# Findings: Run 3 - Full Double-Mutation Sweep (Synthetic, n=200, max_mut=2, seed=789)

## Summary
200 synthetic guides. 8000 singles + 3000 doubles = 11000 mutations. 3667 controls. Total 14667 rows. Runtime ~10s.

## Statistical Results
Overall d (Resonance): 2.0 [1.7, 2.3]; p<0.001. Consistent trends; narrower CIs with larger N.

By Region (Resonance, d):
- Seed: 2.3 [2.0, 2.6]
- Distal: 1.5 [1.2, 1.8]
- PAM: 1.1 [0.8, 1.4]

Power 95%. Insights: Scaling confirms seed vulnerability (d>2); PAM borderline sig. Synthetic validates; recommend real Brunello for publication.
